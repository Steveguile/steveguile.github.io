[ I've created my very first YouTube video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuMWGR5YD7Y). In recent history at least, there is a video of 15 year old me playing bass somewhere on that site.

The video explores the Lua programming language from scratch with the intention that at the end of the video, listeners are be able to write Lua programs.
