Besides software engineering, my main topics of interest are machine learning, IT security and computer vision. I'm  also starting a career as beer connoisseur, and suffer from an unhealthy passion for football.

One of my favorite things in the world is spending time in my home in the Colombian countryside with this dude:

He got a little daughter some years ago, this Terra a couple of weeks old:

Feel free to hit me up in case you need more newfie pictures or wanna chat about stuff. Alternatively, you can meet me personally at Munich's local [C++ user group](https://www.meetup.com/MUCplusplus/).

And btw I use Arch Linux.
