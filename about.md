I'm  also starting a career as beer connoisseur, and suffer from an unhealthy passion for football.

One of my favorite things in the world is spending time in my home in the Colombian countryside with my dude Nova:

Feel free to hit me up in case you need more newfie pictures.

And btw I use Arch Linux.
